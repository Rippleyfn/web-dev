            <p>In the ancient world, the Royal Library of Alexandria stood as the ultimate beacon of human knowledge—a place where the greatest minds gathered to share and preserve the wisdom of every known civilization. Tragically, history saw that flame extinguished, and countless works of philosophy, science, and literature were lost to time.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to rebuild that beacon in the digital age. Alexandria's Library is a dedicated effort to archive every book, manuscript, and thought from around the globe. By creating a decentralized, accessible home for world literature, we ensure that no story is ever truly lost again. Whether it's a foundational philosophical treatise or a modern fantasy epic, we believe every word deserves a place on our shelves.</p>
